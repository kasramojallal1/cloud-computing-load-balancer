# Cloud Computing Load Balancer

This project implements a load balancer for a cloud computing environment. The load balancer distributes incoming network traffic across multiple backend servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed. This enhances the overall performance and reliability of the cloud service.

## Project Overview

The load balancer manages traffic distribution to backend virtual machines (VMs) and ensures efficient handling of client requests. The key components of this project include:

1. **Backend VM Script (`backend-vm.py`)**: This script manages the backend virtual machines that handle the actual client requests. Each VM operates independently, providing the necessary computational resources.

2. **Host Script (`host.py`)**: This script is responsible for managing the host environment where the VMs are deployed. It oversees the lifecycle of the VMs, including their creation, monitoring, and deletion.

3. **Load Balancer Script (`load-ball.py`)**: This is the core script for the load balancer. It monitors incoming client requests and distributes them across the available backend VMs based on a chosen load-balancing algorithm.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**: The host environment initializes and prepares a pool of backend VMs, ready to handle incoming client requests.

2. **Request Handling**: The load balancer receives client requests and assigns them to the backend VMs based on the current load and availability of each VM. This ensures optimal utilization of resources and prevents any single VM from becoming a bottleneck.

3. **Load Balancing Algorithm**: The load balancer employs a specific algorithm (e.g., round-robin, least connections, or resource-based) to decide how to distribute the requests. This algorithm ensures a balanced distribution of workload across the VMs.

4. **Monitoring and Scaling**: The host script continuously monitors the performance and load on each VM. If the demand increases, the system can scale up by adding more VMs. Conversely, if the demand decreases, it can scale down by removing unnecessary VMs.

## Results

This load balancer implementation improves the efficiency and reliability of the cloud computing environment by ensuring balanced distribution of client requests. The key outcomes include:

- **Improved Performance**: By distributing the load evenly, the system avoids performance bottlenecks and ensures faster response times for client requests.

- **Enhanced Reliability**: The load balancer's ability to scale up or down based on demand ensures that the system remains reliable even under varying loads.

- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient distribution of requests leads to optimal utilization of computational resources, reducing wastage and improving cost-effectiveness.
